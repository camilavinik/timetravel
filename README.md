# Quick Start

### Installation

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment Configuration**
   
   **IMPORTANT**: A `.env` file is required for the application to function properly. This file is attached to the submission and contains the necessary environment variables, so no additional configuration is required on this step.
   
   The `.env` file should contain:
   ```env
   EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
   EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   ```

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

5. **Run on your preferred platform**
   - **iOS Simulator**: Press `i` in the terminal or scan the QR code with your camera app
   - **Android Emulator**: Press `a` in the terminal
   - **Web Browser**: Press `w` in the terminal
   - **Physical Device**: Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app
